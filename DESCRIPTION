Title: Toolset for Coupled Niche-population Paleo-climatic Models
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Global Ecology Lab
Maintainer: Sean Haythorne <sean.haythorne@adelaide.edu.au>
Description: The toolset provides a collection of interoperable R6 classes for simulating multiple
    spatially-explicit demographic-based population models that utilize paleo-climatic niche model 
    data. Included are classes for building population models and associated models for representing 
    niche carrying capacities (derived from paleo-climatic niche models), spatial dispersal, and 
    human density (for impact/harvesting functionality). A Latin hypercube sampling tool is provided 
    to generate sampled parameters for multiple model simulations. A multi-simulation manager tool 
    is provided to run and log simulations, with the assistance of model generator and simulator 
    classes, and to collect simulation results. The toolset utilizes a hierarchy of class 
    inheritance, with additional abstract classes being defined with reusable attributes and 
    methods.
