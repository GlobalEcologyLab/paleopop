Title: Pattern-oriented Modelling Framework for Coupled Niche-population Paleo-climatic Models
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Global Ecology Lab
Maintainer: Sean Haythorne <sean.haythorne@adelaide.edu.au>
Description: This pattern-oriented modelling (POM) framework provides a collection of 
    interoperable R6 classes for simulating multiple spatially-explicit demographic-based
    population models that utilize paleo-climatic niche model data, and for selecting the
    simulation models that best fit observed data via an Approximate Bayesian Analysis
    (ABC) validation method.
    Included are classes for building population models and associated generative models
    for representing niche carrying capacities (derived from paleo-climatic niche models),
    spatial dispersal, and human density (for impact/harvesting functionality). A Latin
    hypercube sampling class is provided to generate sampled parameters for multiple model
    simulations. A multi-simulation manager class is provided to run and log simulations,
    and to collect simulation results. A simulator class is provided to wrap a simulation
    function, the default being the paleopop simulation function, which is optimized for
    single-generation transitions and large populations. Finally, classes for collating
    results into summary metrics and for running ABC validation and model selection are 
    provided. The framework utilizes a hierarchy of class inheritance, with additional 
    abstract classes being defined with reusable attributes and methods.
